### DIY windows terminal here ðŸ‘‡

* This article is all about making your windows terminal look cool

* In order to understand how it works, you need to spend some time watching the video mentioned in 'References' [^1] also you need to spend sometime on configuration of 'starship.toml' which I have already shared which I'm personally using. 

* So, if you don't want to do any sort of configuration stuffs just be my guest; copy the 'starship.toml' file & I promise you won't regret it and ofcourse you can thank me later

* So, jumping on to the main reason why we need to tweak our terminal
- It's because of the limited number of colors that can be displayed in a normal command prompt. The default color scheme provided by Microsoft

* I think I'm feeling lazy a bit, so why not you try to explore the References mentioned at the end of this article and figure out what you want out of it.

* In case you may find it difficult to search for some specific icons, just refer "Nerd Fonts Cheat Sheet", serach for any icon by it's name and copy the icon according to your requirement. By the way, I'm using Hack Nord Fonts

* For your convenience, if you are using Windows 10/11, try installing WSL/ubuntu-22.04/Arch linux/kali linux from the Microsoft store

* Reason why I mentioned multiple Linux distributions is because their terminals are automatically added as a profile with default settings to your Windows Terminal and they look pretty much amazing. 

* Having multiple terminals of Linux without installing any hypervisor isn't that cool. Like you're running a shell inside a windows 10/11 without any VMware / Virtual Box / etc.

* For Mac users, I'll suggest go with Nerd Fonts installations and then configuring starship.toml as it's already a UNIX based system

* I'm trying everything I can to help people understand this Article and if anything goes missing in this article feel free to ask questions or else you can do pull requests and I'll try to reply/update the responses to this article


Thanks
